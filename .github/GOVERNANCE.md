# Governance

## Introduction

This document describes the governance principles and guidelines for [Your Repository Name]. The purpose is to ensure clarity and consistency in how the project progresses and evolves.
Project Maintainers

The project is overseen by a group of maintainers. These individuals have the final say on technical decisions, feature implementations, and overall project direction.

**Current Maintainers:**
- [@BangladeshOS](https://github.com/BangladeshOS)

**Maintainers have the following responsibilities:**
- Review and merge pull requests.
- Address and moderate any disputes or conflicts.
- Ensure the sustainability and consistency of the project.
- Announce major decisions, updates, or changes to the community.

## Contributing

Anyone can contribute to the project. Contributions can come in the form of code, documentation, design, and more. All contributors are encouraged to create a pull request and engage in discussions. For more information, refer to our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/bangladeshos/bangladeshos.github.io/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Decision Making

- **Consensus**: For most decisions, we seek a consensus among contributors. If there's disagreement, we encourage discussion to reach an agreement.
- **Voting**: In rare instances where consensus cannot be reached, project maintainers may use a voting system. A simple majority will determine the outcome.
- **Veto Power**: Project maintainers reserve the right to unilaterally make decisions on critical issues or veto proposals they believe are not in the best interest of the project.

- **Raise an Issue**: Create an issue in our GitHub repository detailing which contributions you'd like removed and your reasons.

- **Provide Details**: Mention the specific contributions you're referring to and how you'd like to be attributed.
- **Attribution Adjustment**: After verification, the maintainers will ensure proper attribution is provided in subsequent releases or documentation updates.

## Transparency and Impartiality

### Commitment to Transparency

Our project thrives on open collaboration and trust. We believe in fostering an environment where decisions, processes, and actions stand up to public scrutiny. To this end:

- **Clear Affiliations**: If you are submitting a PR or an issue that promotes, links to, or benefits a product/service you're affiliated with, you must clearly disclose this relationship.
- **Maintainer Pledge**: We, the maintainers, pledge not to censor, alter, or delete any content to protect our personal interests. Our actions are always in the best interest of the community.

### Conflict of Interest

A conflict of interest arises when personal interests may compromise the ability to act in the best interests of the project and its community. Both maintainers and contributors should be vigilant in recognizing and handling conflicts of interest:

- **Declaration**: If you perceive a potential conflict of interest, declare it openly. For maintainers, this may be in a public space such as the project's communication channels. For contributors, this might be within the relevant PR or issue.
- **Recusal**: In cases where a conflict of interest is determined, the affected individual should refrain from the decision-making process or from the action in question.
- **Third-Party Mediation**: In situations where the path forward is unclear, consider seeking external opinions or mediation to ensure impartiality.

### Community at Heart

Our primary allegiance is to the community and the collective good. We promise to:

- **Prioritize Community**: Decisions are made with the community's best interest in mind.
- **Open Discussions**: Encourage open discussions and feedback. Every voice, whether in agreement or dissent, is valuable and should be heard.
- **Clear Documentation**: All decisions, especially those that affect the project's direction, are documented and accessible.
- **Acknowledge Mistakes**: We are human, and mistakes will happen. When they do, we'll own up to them, learn, and act to rectify.

By adhering to these principles, we hope to foster a transparent, impartial, and trusting environment for all our contributors and users.


## Conflict Resolution

In the case of conflicts or disputes among contributors:
- Try to settle differences through direct communication between parties involved.
- If unresolved, bring the issue to the larger community for discussion.
- As a last resort, project maintainers will intervene and make a final decision.

## Code of Conduct
