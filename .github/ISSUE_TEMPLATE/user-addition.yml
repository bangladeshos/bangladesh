        If you want your name to be listed in the readme, you should submit a
        pull request, editing
        [`bangladesh-bot.yml`](https://github.com/bangladeshos/bangladeshos.github.io/blob/main/bangladesh-bot.yml)
        and following the guidelines in the [contributing
        doc](https://github.com/bangladeshos/bangladeshos.github.io/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
        If you're unsure how to get started, there are plenty of
        [guides](https://github.com/bangladeshos/bangladesh#open-source-guides)
        and resources linked to in the readme


        You're welcome to proceed with submitting a ticket to get your response
        listed, but it may take much longer, and the preferred method is a PR
        (plus it's a great learning opportunity!)
